------------------------
*We have ported the project from Eclipse to [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) to continue the development as [Android Studio has become the official IDE for Android development](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html). The repository of the SenSee project using Android Studio is at [the SenSee Project with Android Studio](https://github.com/sysnetlab/SenSee). The developers has no plan to keep this repository updated.*

The Sensor Data Collector is an Android tool that collects sensor data in user-defined experiments. The purpose is to enable developers and researchers to quickly collect sensor data for research and prototyping. The sensors are broadly defined to include Android Sensors (Android.Hardware.Sensors), Cameras (still images and videos), Audio (microphones), WiFi, Bluetooth, Battery, and user-defined pseudo sensors.

The Sensor Data Collector tool is a creation of the <a href="http://sysnetgrp.net/">SysNet Lab</a>.
